**The processing & cleaning strategy is as followed:**
- Renaming columns from French to English
- Removing unused columns (like Function, Competition locations, Medals, etc.).
- Dropping duplicate rows.
- Converting birth dates to datetime.
- Filling missing heights with the median value.
- Removing rows missing essential fields (Discipline and/or Gender, and Age if still missing).
